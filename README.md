## 🥭 About The Project

Mango is made to work in tandem with Shopify Theme Kit, Webpack and a little bit of NodeJS magic.

The goal of mango, was to provide developers with a quick and easy setup to start using modern day technologies when doing Shopify development and to solve the baseline issues Theme Kit was having.

Mango makes sure all needed Theme Kit & web pack commands are ran in conjunction with one another, while working out of one terminal.

Mango aims to provide a set ideology, with a direct and concise Project Scaffolding to allow for rapid and modern development on Shopify.



### 🥭 Built With

Mango is purely open source and built with NodeJS.




## 🥭 Getting Started



### 🥭 Installation

```sh
npm install @shopackify/mango -g
```



## 🥭 Usage



### 🥭 Initializing a Project

`mango init` will set up the base project, copy all of the configuration files.



### 🥭 Files Mango rely on

Mango actively looks for:

1. `webpack.config.js`
2. `webpack.production.config.js`
3. `mango.config.yml`
4. `config.yml`

These files should be in your project root at all times.



### 🥭 Configuration Files

##### config.yml

Stores all of your Shopify environment data, mango will read and write from this when needing to make API calls.

```yaml
development:
  password: example_password
  theme_id: "1234567890123"
  store: example.myshopify.com
  directory: shop/dist
  ignores:
  - themekit_ignores
  
staging:
  password: example_password
  theme_id: "1234567890123"
  store: example.myshopify.com
  directory: shop/dist
  ignores:
  - themekit_ignores
  
production:
  password: example_password
  theme_id: "1234567890123"
  store: example.myshopify.com
  directory: shop/dist
  ignores:
  - themekit_ignores
```



##### mango.config.yml

Currently only stores a key/value pair of each store & password, these are used to make API requests to Shopify for dynamically getting `config/settings_data.json` and deploying to uncreated themes.

```yaml
store: example.myshopify.com
password: example_password
```



##### webpack.config.js and webpack.production.config.js

Mango uses both of these files as core files. The production config is only ever used on build, and the standard config is used while watching. To learn more about webpack configuration files see: https://webpack.js.org/



### 🥭 Caveats

Mango uses Chokidar under the hood and rely's on both `./shop/dist` & `./shop/src` folders to work.

Theme Kit watches the `./shop/dist` folder for changes, while Chokidar watches and moves anything from the src folders to their respective distrobution folder.



### 🥭 What to expect

Using the recommended config `mango init -r` or `mango init --recommended` will setup the project directory with all of the recommended configurations out of the box.

If you'd like to do something completely different or custom, you can run  `mango init -s` mango doesn't deny you this right, only as long as you fork the tooling and update the directory's privately or you follow the below directory structure.
